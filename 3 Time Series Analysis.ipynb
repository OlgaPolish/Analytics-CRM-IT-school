    "- The number of deals also grew from 655 in July 2023 to a peak of 3081 in March 2024, then decreased to 1674 in June 2024.  \n",
    "- The number of completed calls shows a similar dynamic, increasing from 4 in July 2023 to 10026 in March 2024 and decreasing to 6212 in June 2024.  \n",
    "- It is evident that there is a close connection between the number of calls and deals - an increase in calls leads to an increase in the number of deals, while a decrease in calls leads to a reduction in deals.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**The dynamics of the conversion rate:**  \n",
    "- At the beginning (July 2023), the conversion rate was quite high - 0.34. This means that out of 100 calls during this period, about 34 deals were made.  \n",
    "- But then the rate began to decline. By May 2024, it had dropped to 0.21.  \n",
    "- Then the situation stabilized somewhat - the rate held at around 0.22-0.23 from March to April 2024.  \n",
    "- Thus, despite the increase in the overall number of calls and deals, the effectiveness of working with clients (the ability to convert calls into actual deals) was declining."

    "- **Efficiency with a Low Number of Deals**  \n",

    "As the number of deals increases to 400–577 (for example, 489 in November 2023 or 577 in April 2024), the duration increases to 14–23.7 days. This may indicate a lack of personnel or that the process is becoming more complicated.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Heatmap of Deal Duration by Months of Creation and Closure**  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Recommendations**  \n",
    "As the number of deals increases, the average duration of their closure also increases. This may indicate a lack of resources or complexities in the process. It is recommended to review task distribution and possibly increase the number of employees during peak periods."
