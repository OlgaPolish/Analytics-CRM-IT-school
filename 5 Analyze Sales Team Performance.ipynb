    "# Conclusions\n",
    "1. Effectiveness of Deal Owners\n",
    "The analysis of the effectiveness of deal owners (Deal Owner Name) and advertising campaigns based on the provided data reveals key differences in performance. Deal owners handled between 1 and 2,963 leads, with conversion rates ranging from 0% to 30.7% and total sales amounts from $0 to $5,117,800.00.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The most effective in terms of conversion was **Oliver Taylor** with 30.7% (50 successful deals out of 163 leads) and total sales of $152,650.00, highlighting his exceptional ability to close deals with a relatively small volume of leads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, in terms of the number of leads processed, **Charlie Davis** (2,963 leads) and **Ulysses Adams** (2,165 leads) lead the way. Their conversion rates are 5% and 6.5%, respectively, with sales amounts of $3,822,500.00 and $5,117,800.00, making them leaders in overall contribution to total sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Among the less active operators, such as **John Doe** (20 leads, 5% conversion) or **George King** (94 leads, 2.1% conversion), low sales amounts ($4,600.00 and $2,900.00, respectively) are noticeable, indicating limited effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operators with zero conversion, such as **Amy Green**, **Alice Johnson**, **Sam Young**, **Rachel White**, and others, require a review of strategy, as they did not close any deals while processing leads. For example, **Rachel White** processed 871 leads but did not close a single deal, resulting in total sales of only $14,000.00.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "The analysis showed that the most effective deal owners are **Oliver Taylor**, **Ulysses Adams**, and **Charlie Davis**, who demonstrate high results in both sales volume and conversion rate. However, there is significant potential for improvement among owners with low effectiveness, especially those who have not closed any deals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "1. Conduct training for deal owners to enhance their lead management skills.\n",
    "2. Optimize the lead distribution strategy to focus on more promising operators.\n",
    "3. Analyze the reasons for low conversion rates among operators with a large number of leads, such as **Rachel White** and **Nina Scott**, to address potential issues."
